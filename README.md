# Company_Classifier

In this document, I will present my thought process. If you want to see the solution for the challenge, you can find it in the Jupyter notebook `Company_Classifier`.

In the CSV folder, you will find two directories: one called `Data`, which contains the untouched data and the cleaned data that I used, and one called `Tries`, where I stored all the predictions that I made.
